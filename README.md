# `joinery`: Safe SQL transpiler, written in Rust

It was decided to write a greenfield transpiler in Rust due to concerns about correctness of Python-based solutions.

[BigQuery "Standard SQL"](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/query-syntax) was taken as the reference dialect, but it is anticipated the other input dialects will be supported.

It performs type inference (necessary, for example, to expand `EXCEPT(*)` into a list of columns, because Trino doesn't support it) and preserves whitespace.

If you want to run _your_ production workloads, **you will almost certainly need to contribute code.** In particular, our API coverage is limited. See [`tests/sql/`](./tests/sql/) for examples of what we support.

See [ARCHITECTURE.md](./ARCHITECTURE.md) for an overview of the codebase.

## What is this?

This is an experimental tool to transpile (some) SQL code written in BigQuery's "Standard SQL" dialect into other dialects. For example, it can transform:

```sql
SELECT ARRAY(
    SELECT DISTINCT val / 2
    FROM UNNEST(arr) AS val
    WHERE MOD(val, 2) = 0
) AS arr
FROM array_select_data;
```

...into the Trino-compatible SQL:

```sql
SELECT ARRAY_DISTINCT(
    TRANSFORM(
        FILTER(arr, val -> MOD(val, 2) = 0),
        val -> val / 2
    )
) AS arr
FROM array_select_data
```

It even does type inference, which is needed for certain complex transformations! The transformation process makes some effort to preserve whitespace and comments, so the output SQL is still mostly readable.

## Design philosophy

In an _ideal_ world, `joinery` would do one of two things:

1. Translate your SQL into something that runs identically on your target database, or
2. Report a clear error explaining why it can't.

In the real world, neither BigQuery's Standard SQL nor any of our target dialects have any kind of formal semantics, and there has been way too much empiricism and guesswork involved. But `joinery` has been designed to approach the ideal over time.

## Installing

```bash
git clone https://github.com/faradayio/joinery.git
cd joinery
cargo install --path .
```

## Running

```bash
joinery --help
joinery parse example_queries.csv
joinery sql-test tests/sql/
```

For the `sql-test` test format, see the [test format docs][tests].

[tests]: ./tests/sql/README.md

## Supported databases

### SQLite3

This is the default. You don't need to do anything.

### Snowflake

You can specify Snowflake using

```txt
--database snowflake://<user>@<organization>-<account>[.privatelink]/<warehouse>/<database>
```

You'll also need to set the `SNOWFLAKE_PASSWORD` environment variable.

### Trino

To run under Trino, you may want to load the plugin, as described in [`java/trino-plugin/README.md`](./java/trino-plugin/README.md). If you don't mind some unit test failures on `FARM_FINGERPRINT`, you can also just run:

```bash
docker run --name trino -d -p 8080:8080 trinodb/trino
```

Then you need to start a Trino shell:

```bash
docker exec -it trino trino
```

...and paste in the contents of [`./sql/trino_compat.sql`](./sql/trino_compat.sql). This will provide SQL UDFs which mirror a bunch of BigQuery's built in functions.

Then you can run `joinery` with:

```txt
--database "trino://anyone@localhost/memory/default"
```

## Other projects of interest

If you're interested in running analytic SQL queries across multiple databases, you may also be interested in:

- [PRQL](https://prql-lang.org/). There are a lot of languages out there that compile to SQL, but this one is my favorite. It reads as a pipeline from top to bottom, the features are clean and orthogonal, and it handles window functions. If you're starting a greenfield project, definitely take a look.
- [Logica](https://logica.dev/). This is probably the most mature Datalog-to-SQL compiler, with a particular focus on BigQuery.
- [`sqlglot`](https://github.com/tobymao/sqlglot). Transform between many different SQL dialects. Much better feature coverage than we have, though it may generate incorrect SQL in tricky cases. If you're planning on adjusting your translated queries by hand, or if you need to support a wide variety of dialects, this is probably a better choice than `joinery`.
- [`dbt-core`](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-core).
- [BigQuery Emulator](https://github.com/goccy/bigquery-emulator). A local emulator for BigQuery. This supports a larger fraction of BigQuery features than we do.
